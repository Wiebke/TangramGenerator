\section{Overall Application Structure}

Commucate with database

\section{Generation Process}

First Naive Approach

As a first step towards the generation of interesting tangrams, the generation algorithms should favour configurations in which tans do not only have vertices, but also edges in common. 

\section{Interestingness Measures}
convex hull

\section{Gameplay}
Outline computation
Snapping
