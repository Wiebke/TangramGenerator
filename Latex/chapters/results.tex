\section{Generation Process}

Comparison of the two algorithms
Comparison of what happens with different settings for probability -> sufficiently large number of tangrams generated no visible difference on the first 6 tangrams

\section{Interestingness Measures}

Results of different measures

\subsection{User testing}

In addition to the interface described in section \ref{} evaluation interface 
Out of 1000 tangrams
with properties. 
compact
holes
just one hanging piece
small edges
First six were the same for all users
Overall .. took part.
