	Annote = {- description of three ways to calculate the probability of the pattern, each requires to know all possible solutions to the pattern
- 1. way: probability based on correct placement of a piece and number of ways it could be placed (number of rotations that result into a different piece) - measure should result in the same probability for each solution and is just scaled by number of solutions (which is later scaled according to experiments again?)
- 2. way: probabilty based on possibilites to reach a certain length, unclear which length are being taken into account 
- 3. way: probability based on cutting of basic shapes
- overall: 
 - patterns that are more regular are harder, patterns where there is only one possibilty to place a piece a easier.
 - seems computationally costly to automate (full solution computation and multiple orders of placement)
(- very bad English, should this be cited?)},
